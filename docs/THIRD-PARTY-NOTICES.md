## Oriserve/Whisper-Hindi2Hinglish-Swift

Model by [Oriserve](https://oriserve.com). Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0
(<https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>); a copy of the license is attached to the
[`models-hinglish-swift-1`](https://github.com/shivam098/windows-voice-assistant/releases/tag/models-hinglish-swift-1) release.

It is fine-tuned from OpenAI's `whisper-base`, and the converted file also contains OpenAI Whisper's mel filter bank and
tokenizer vocabulary. Those are Copyright (c) 2022 OpenAI under the MIT License; OpenAI's license text is attached to the
same release.

**Changes made:** the original Hugging Face weights were converted to the ggml format and quantized to 8-bit (q8_0) so
whisper.cpp can run them; the model itself was not retrained. The steps are in
[tools/ModelConvert/README.md](../tools/ModelConvert/README.md). The model is distributed "AS IS", without warranties
or conditions of any kind.
